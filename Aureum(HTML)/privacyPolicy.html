                            Changes to This Privacy Policy

                            prior

                            THE USE
                            OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR FOR ANY LOSS CAUSED BY ANY UNAUTHORIZED PERSON OR ENTITY
                            USING THE
                            INFORMATION OR CONTENT YOU DISCLOSE ON OUR WEBSITE.</p>

                        <li>Explaining the legal basis we rely on</li>
                        <p>
                            The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which a company may
                            collect
                            and process your personal data, including:

                            Contractual obligations

                            In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual
                            obligations.

                            For example, if you order an item from us for home delivery, we'll collect your address
                            details to
                            deliver your purchase and pass them to our courier.

                            Legal compliance

                            If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.

                            For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity
                            affecting
                            Aureum (or its affiliates or subsidiaries) to law enforcement.

                            Legitimate interest

                            In specific situations, we require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way
                            that might
                            reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact
                            your
                            rights, freedom, or interests.

                            For example, we will use your purchase history to send you or make available personalized
                            offers.

                            We also combine the shopping history of many customers to identify trends and ensure we can
                            keep up
                            with demand or develop new products/services.

        <li><b>Security - How we store your data</b></li>
        <p>
            We are committed to ensuring that personal information is secure. All non-financial
            information
            provided to us is stored on our secure servers. To prevent unauthorized access or
            disclosure, We
            have taken all reasonable steps and put in place suitable safeguards to secure the
            information we
            collect from you.
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
            Although
            we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your
            data
            transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received
            personal
            information, we will use the necessary procedures and security features to try to prevent
            unauthorized access. We will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that personal
            information
            and data are treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <li>How and why do we use your personal data?</li>
        <p>
            We want to give you the best possible customer experience. One way to achieve that is to get the richest
            picture
            we can of who you are by combining the data we have about you.

            We then use this to offer you promotions, products and services that are most likely to interest you.

            The data privacy law allows this as part of our legitimate interest in understanding our customers and
            providing
            the highest levels of service.

            Of course, if you wish to change how we use your data, you'll find details in Section __below “What are your
            rights over your personal data?”

            Remember, if you choose not to share your personal data with us, or refuse certain contact permissions, we
            might
            not be able to provide some services you've asked for.

            For example, if you've asked us to let you know when an item comes back into stock, we can't do that if
            you've
            withdrawn your general consent to hear from us. Here's how we'll use your personal data and why:


        <ol>
            <li>To process any orders that you make by using our websites or in store. If we don’t collect your personal
                data
                during checkout, we won’t be able to process your order and comply with our legal obligations. For
                example,
                your
                details may need to be passed to a third party to supply or deliver the product or service that you
                ordered,
                and
                we may keep your details for a reasonable period afterwards in order to fulfil any contractual
                obligations
                such
                as refunds etc.</li>
            <li>To respond to your queries, refund requests and complaints. Handling the information you sent enables us
                to
                respond. We may also keep a record of these to provide information about any future communication with
                us
                and to
                demonstrate how we communicated with you throughout. We do this on the basis of providing you with the
                best
                service and understanding how we can improve our service based on your experience.</li>
            <li>To protect our business and your account from fraud and other illegal activities. This includes using
                your
                personal data to maintain, update and safeguard your account. We'll also monitor your browsing activity
                with
                us
                to quickly identify and resolve any problems and protect the integrity of our websites. We'll do all of
                this
                as
                part of our legitimate interest. For example, by checking your password when you login and using
                automated
                monitoring of IP addresses to identify possible fraudulent log-ins from unexpected locations.</li>
            <li>To process payments and to prevent fraudulent transactions. We do this on the basis of our legitimate
                business
                interests. This also helps to protect our customers from fraud. If we discover any criminal activity or
                alleged
                criminal activity through our use of CCTV, fraud monitoring and suspicious transaction monitoring, we
                will
                process this data for the purposes of preventing or detecting unlawful acts. Our aim is to protect the
                individuals we interact with from criminal activities.</li>
            <li>With your consent, we will use your personal data, preferences and details of your transactions to keep
                you
                informed by email, web, text, telephone about relevant products and services including tailored special
                offers,
                discounts, promotions, competitions and so on. Of course, you are free to opt out of hearing from us by
                any
                of
                these channels at any time.</li>
            <li>To send you communications required by law, or which are necessary to information about our products,
                such
                as
                product recall notices and legally required information relating to your orders. These service messages
                will
                not
                include any promotional content and do not require prior consent when sent by email or text message. If
                we
                do
                not use your personal data for these purposes, we would be unable to comply with our legal obligations.
            </li>
            <li> To develop, test and improve the systems, services and products we provide to you. We'll do this on the
                basis of
                our legitimate business interests. For example, we'll record your browser's Session ID to help us
                understand
                more when you leave us online feedback about any problems you're having</li>
            <li>
                To comply with our contractual or legal obligations to share data with law enforcement. For example,
                when a
                court order is submitted to share data with law enforcement agencies or a court of law</li>

            <li>
                Combining your data for personalised direct marketing. We want to bring you offers and promotions that
                are

        </ol>



        </p>

        <li>How long will we keep your personal data?</li>
        <p> Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we'll only keep it for as long as is necessary for the
            purpose for which it was collected. Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we'll only keep it

        <li>Who do we share your personal data with?</li>
        <p>We sometimes share your personal data with trusted third parties. For example, delivery couriers, for fraud
            management, to handle complaints, to help us personalise our offers to you and so on. Here's the policy we
            apply
            to those organisations to keep your data safe and protect your privacy: <br /><br />

            We provide only the information they need to perform their specific services. They may only use your data
            for
            the exact purposes we specify in our contract with them. We work closely with them to ensure that your
            privacy
            is respected and protected at all times. If we stop using their services, any of your data held by them will
            either be deleted or rendered anonymous. Examples of the kind of third parties we work with are:<br /><br />

            IT companies who support our website and other business systems. Operational companies such as delivery
            couriers. Direct marketing companies who help us manage our electronic communications with you.
            Google/Facebook
            to show you products that might interest you while you’re browsing the internet. This is based on either
            your
            marketing consent or your acceptance of cookies on our websites. Data insight companies to ensure your
            details
            are up to date and accurate.<br /><br />

            Sharing your data with third parties for their own purposes:<br /><br />

            We will only do this in very specific circumstances, for example:<br /><br />

            For fraud management, we may share information about fraudulent or potentially fraudulent activity in our
            premises or systems. This may include sharing data about individuals with law enforcement bodies. We may
            also be
            required to disclose your personal data to the police or other enforcement, regulatory or Government body,
            in
            your country of origin or elsewhere, upon a valid request to do so. These requests are assessed on a
            case-by-case basis and take the privacy of our customers into consideration.</p>

            browsing habits, such as what areas of the Website are visited most frequently. At times we may gather
            information through the use of a cookie file which enables us to gather statistical information regarding
            the
            use of our Website. This helps us to improve not only our Website, but the services we can provide to you.
            We
            may use analytical software to track user habits and trends.<br /><br />

            You do have the choice to decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but people can
            usually modify their browser setting to decline cookies if they prefer. Should you choose to decline cookies

            control.<br /><br />

            IP Address<br /><br />

            An IP (Internet protocol) Address is automatically assigned to the computer that someone is using by their
            Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever
            someone visits our Website. This also allows us to identify the time(s) of visit(s) and the page(s) of the
            Website that have been visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done
            automatically by many Third Party Sites.<br /><br />

            Location Information<br /><br />

            We may also obtain information about your physical location, such as by use of GPS and other geolocation
            features in your computer, laptop or mobile device, or from other information we collect. For example, a
            your IP
            Address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet.<br /><br />
        </p>

        <li>Where your personal data may be processed</li>
        <p>
            Sometimes we will need to share your personal data with our employees or third parties for marketing and
            customer relationship management and those employees or third parties may be located anywhere in the world.

            support services. If we do this, we have procedures in place to ensure your data receives the necessary
            protection.

            Any transfer of your personal data will follow applicable laws and we will treat the information under the
            guiding principles of this Privacy Notice.
